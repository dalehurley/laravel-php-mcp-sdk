## üìù Versioning Note

This package is being released as v0.1.0 (pre-release) to align with the PHP MCP SDK which is currently at v0.1.7. This follows semantic versioning best practices:

- Pre-1.0 dependencies typically mean the dependent package should also be pre-1.0
- Signals to users that the API may still undergo changes
- Version 1.0.0 will be released when the PHP MCP SDK reaches v1.0 and our API is stable

## üéâ Release Ready!

The package is now ready for v0.1.0 pre-release. Follow the steps above to publish.
